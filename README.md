# Countries

A list of countries in the world, and some data about them.

This is **not** identical to the ISO 3166 list - this is a combination of supported countries from our carrier partners.


We can ship to all of these places, so you can safely use this list in a dropdown picker.

## Attributes

- `name`: The name of the country
- `alpha-2`: The ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code for the country
- `aliases`: Some other names for the country (e.g. to match against if you're parsing user input)
  - These aliases are subjective and there could be a lot more - feel free to add them!:
